# Powershell-Token-Grabber

Replace YOUR_WEBHOOK_HERE with your webhook and u chillin

use https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation if u need help lmk and I can walk you through how to use it. You can also use Somalifuscator (in my github) for the bat file but option 3 WILL NOT WORK (option 2 will and 1)
